May it be the field of academic, sports, co/extra-curricular activities, or development, the DPS presents tremendous challenges for a Principal. It is by no means an easy task to match the testing standards set by the founder Principal of DPS Sahiwal Lt. Col. (R) M. Arif Chohan. In a short span of time, the DPS Sahiwal has become the first choice of parents at Sahiwal, because of the outstanding achievements in curricular and co-curricular fields. The grandeur of the vast campus of DPS, arrangements of its lawns and floriculture put it in bracket with the best institutions of the province."  TextColor="Black" />

DPS lays special emphasis on quality of teaching and learning and we are proud that our faculty puts in its best to come up to the standards set by the DPS." TextColor="Black" FontSize="15"></Label>
                    <Label Text=" The Community and Board of Governors of Sahiwal Educational Trust always take keen interest in the development activities and keep a close watch on the performance of the institution.
